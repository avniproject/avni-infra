### Configure Avni
This directory contains Ansible scripts to deploy Avni on servers. It does not assume any infrastructure, and can be used for deployment on in-premise scenarios. 

For in-premise scenarios, some additional software such as firewalls, web servers and databases might need to be additionally configured. This is not true on the Avni cloud where it is handled through provisioned infrastructure. When using these scripts for the Avni cloud deployment, or other cloud deployment, these will need to be turned off.
